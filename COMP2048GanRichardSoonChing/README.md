This is a school project for my Software Maintanence Module

Name: Richard Gan Soon Ching
Student ID : 20303960

I coded this program in Intellij so first download javafx. After u download javafx go to the top bar and click 
file-> Project Structure. Then go to library-> + symbol and click on new Java library, go to where ur javafx library is
and import it into ur file. U should be able to run the game.

My javadocs is stored within the folder COMP2042GanRichardSoonChing. The path is \COMP2048GanRichardSoonChing\javadoc\index.html

List of features that are implemented and are working properly
- Fixed score
- Fixed spawning issue of tile
- Fixed illegal move spawning tile
- Fixed merged issue
- Added Main Menu
- Added Grid selector in main menu
- Added leaderboard button
- Added leaderboard which displays players name and highscore
- Added color picker
- Added End Game button on game screen
- Added Win screen
- Fixed Quit button on End Game Scene
- Added Text field to save player name and score

Most of the features I have implemented are working. However, I am unable to implement junit test.

I wanted to implement some animation to the game itself but due to time constraints I am unable to implement it.

I have added a second controller to implement the leaderboard menu

I have modified the classes Account, Cell, Controller, EndGame, GameScene and Main.
